## About

A project by Austin Delamar based off of [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) and other popular libraries.

This really started as a stylesheet for my porfolio site. But as I've kept adding pieces to it as I created additional sites. So now, I wanted an easy way to centralize and share it.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork and make changes, then open a pull request to `master` branch.
